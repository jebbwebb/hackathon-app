# Project Overview

This project was created during the Cannatech 2023 hackathon. The challenge assigned to me was to create a UI/UX design for an app that allows users to control farming cultivation pods. The app includes features to manage temperature, humidity, pressure, lighting, table heights, music, and live camera feed.

## Backstory

I embarked on an 8-hour journey to attend the hackathon and dedicated the entire 24-hour time limit to working on this project by myself. The culmination of my efforts resulted in receiving the **2nd place award** for my app. The hackathon was an exceptional event and a remarkable learning experience in my coding journey. It was my first time working with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, and it pushed me to my limits in terms of quickly adopting new technologies. Despite the continuous 24 hours of coding, I was both **astonished** and **proud** of what I was able to achieve.

## Additional Information

After the 24-hour period, I made the deliberate choice not to further modify the code in order to showcase what I could accomplish within such a short timeframe. Although I contemplated refining the project to enhance its presentation, I ultimately decided that doing so would detract from the essence of the hackathon and the reasons why I am **immensely proud** of it.
